URL shorten is a simple example of a URL shortening app. It is designed with Laravel's Jetstream and Inertia with Vue. This simple example consists of three sections: Dashboard, with a pie graph showing the clicks count about top 5 URLs; Urls, this section list into a table the urls management; Add Url Shortened, this is the section where URLs are added and shortened.

Since it is a simple exercise, the CSS styles are not centralized and it has been decided to apply them within the view, although it is not a recommended practice.

You need to authenticate or register to access the app, itÂ´s too easy in two steps.
